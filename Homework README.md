Made every charcters an Array. Broke each string down to Upper and Lower case, numbers and special characters. 

funtion with the prompt of how many characters. Based on the lenght the user chooses, then it runs a series of CONFIRMS for each of the characters. Based on the true of false the user chooses, which is 1-4 character choices, then it runs thru the var pick which is chosen from a concate. Then it runs thru the 

for (var i = 0; i < howMany; i++) {
    var pass = pick[Math.floor(Math.random() * pick.length)];
    password.push(pass);
 }

 Var i equals to zero, if i is lass than how many characters where chosen, then add up 1. Variable which is the password equals to characters that were picked true, run thru math random and rounded down by math floor times the length of the pick. Then we push the password. 


 I hope this makes sense. lol
